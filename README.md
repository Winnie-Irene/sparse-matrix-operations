# Sparse Matrix Operations

This project implements basic operations on **Sparse Matrices**, including:

- **Reading** a sparse matrix from a file.
- **Performing addition, subtraction, and multiplication** on sparse matrices.
- **Handling errors** for incorrect file formats.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure


## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Winnie-Irene/sparse-matrix-operations.git
   cd sparse-matrix-operations

Features
Optimized memory usage for large sparse matrices.
Supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Custom error handling for invalid input formats.

Notes
Do not use built-in libraries like numpy or scipy.
Implement your own data structures.
